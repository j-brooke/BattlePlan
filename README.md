# BattlePlan

A crude tower-defense style game.

## Prerequisits

This app is written in .NET Core, an open-source cross-platform runtime.  You can download the SDK or runtime here:

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

## Running

Right now I'm assuming that anyone trying to run this is a dev, and so they have the SDK installed.  As such, to run,
just navigate to the project directory and type:

    dotnet run play

or

    dotnet run map

Don't worry, it'll get better, but these things take time.

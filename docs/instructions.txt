BattlePlan - A game of epic ASCII tactics
=========================================

INTRO
-----

BattlePlan is a tower-defense game.  Unlike traditional tower-defense, attackers
will adapt to your defenses, and they will try to kill you.  Don't let them.

BattlePlan is currently implemented as a console application, which means you
have to run it from your operating system's commandline: the text window with
the oldschool blinky cursor.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

To run BattlePlan, you need to have the ".NET Core" runtime installed.  This is
a cross-platform version of Microsoft's .NET virtual machine.  It's open source
and free.  It's like Java, but better.

To install it, go to this page:

    https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

Pick the tab for your OS and click the link for the ".NET Core 2.2 Runtime"
installer.  (Although if you're a programmer, there's no harm in downloading
the SDK.)

Note that ".NET Core" is different from ".NET Framework": the latter is a
for Windows only.  As Microsoft naming goes this is actually surprisingly
clear.

Then run the installer and click things that look important.

RUNNING
-------

1. Open a commandline window.

On Windows you get there from:

    Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt

Or not, because everything is always in a different place in every Windows
version.  Alternatively, click Start and then type:

    cmd

On Mac OS, go to the launchpad and click on Terminal.

2. Resize the window.

Your window is probably big enough for the "how to play" maps, but the bigger
ones need more space.  I recommend 40 rows by 100 columns, but it's up to you.
On Mac you can just drag the window corners to resize.  On Windows, you can
drag the top or bottom of the window frame to change the number of rows, but
you need to go to Properties to change the width.

3. Navigate to the BattlePlan directory.

The "cd" command changes your working directory.  Something like:

    cd Downloads/BattlePlan_vX.Y.Z

4. Launch the game menu.

Type:

    dotnet battleplan.dll

You should be in the game menu now.  Choose a section (maybe "how-to-play")
and then choose a scenario.

EDITING
-------

Once you've got a feel for how the game works, assuming it does work, you might
want to try creating some scenarios of your own.  From the commandline, type:

    dotnet battleplan.dll edit

or

    dotnet battleplan.dll edit SomeFileName.json
